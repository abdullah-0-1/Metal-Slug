# 🔫 Metal Slug-Inspired Game (Raylib | PF + OOP Project)

This is a **2D shooting game** inspired by the classic **Metal Slug**, developed in **C++** using **Raylib**. The game was built in two phases:

- 👨‍💻 **Programming Fundamentals (PF):** Core game mechanics with 3 levels
- 👨‍🏫 **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP):** Extended version with 5 total levels and improved structure

---

## 🎮 Game Overview

- Metal Slug-inspired side-scrolling shooter
- Built in **C++ with Raylib** (for graphics and input)
- Designed as part of university coursework (PF + OOP)
- **Score-based level transitions**
- Variety of enemies and level mechanics

> 🧠 All transitions between levels are **score-based** — reach a certain score to progress.

## ⚙️ Features

- 🕹️ Player movement and shooting
- 💥 Enemy spawning and collisions
- 📈 Score tracking and level progression
- 🌆 Multiple level backgrounds/scenes
- 🎨 Raylib-powered visuals
- ✅ Object-oriented code structure (in OOP version)

## 🕹️ Controls

- `W A S D` – Move up, left, down, right  
- `Space` – Fire weapon
- ` E ` - Fire weapon Diagonally
- ` S ` - Shield

## 🧠 Concepts Practiced

- **PF Version:**
  - Loops, conditions, and basic game logic
  - Simple event handling and collisions

- **OOP Version:**
  - Classes (Player, Enemy, Bullet, etc.)
  - Inheritance and encapsulation
  - Better separation of concerns and cleaner codebase
  - Integration with **Raylib** for visuals and input
